Project
The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

Weather
Hotels in the area
The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

Goals :
As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to:

Scrape data from destinations
Get weather data from each destination
Get hotels' info about each destination
Store all the information above in a data lake
Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

Use https://nominatim.org/ to get the gps coordinates of all the cities
Use https://openweathermap.org/appid and https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to get some information about the weather for the 35 cities and put it in a DataFrame
Determine the list of cities where the weather will be the nicest within the next 7 days
Use plotly to display the best destinations on a map
